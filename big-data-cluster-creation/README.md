# Big Data Learning.
## Making a Cluster
Though I am going to use this cluster now for big data leaning, keeping in mind to use this in other purposes as well in the future I am trying to keep this generic as posssible. 

There are so many ways make cluster for testing purpose in localhost. In here I will use simple virutual box.

### Plan
1. Create LinuxMint VM
2. Network between Host and VM
3. Internet in VM
4. Install SSH
5. Install JDK
5. Clone VM to create additional 3 VMs
6. Network between VMs
7. Passwordless ssh between VMs
8. Textmode boot for VMs


#### 1. Create LinuxMint VM
Not going to explain things in detail, Basically we need virtual box, vmware or similar. As I mentioned early I will use virtualbox.

1. Install viritual box
2. Download LinuxMint's Cinnamon No codecs from here http://www.linuxmint.com/download.php
3.   * LinuxMint is lightweight than ubuntu, 
4.   * No codecs is used because we are not going to play music or videos in this machine
5. Create a new VM with 20 GB hd and 2 GB RAM
6. Set the downloaded iso as Storage
7. Start VM and Install LinuxMin
