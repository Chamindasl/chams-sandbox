# Big Data Learning.
## Making a Cluster
Though I am going to use this cluster now for big data leaning, keeping in mind to use this in other purposes as well in the future I am trying to keep this generic as posssible. 

There are so many ways make cluster for testing purpose in localhost. In here I will use simple virutual box.

### Plan
1. Create LinuxMint VM
2. Network between Host and VM
3. Internet in VM
4. Install SSH
5. Install JDK
5. Clone VM to create additional 3 VMs
6. Network between VMs
7. Passwordless ssh between VMs
8. Textmode boot for VMs
